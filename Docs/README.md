## Introduction

### Loading Games

As previously discussed in the root [README.md](../README.md), the TinyEngine loads a single game, written in <b>TinyScript</b> under `$ROOT/programs/main`. This main file is due to act like bootloader for in the future. For now, TinyEngine loads your game under `$ROOT/programs/main`. Let's go on to the fun part!

### About TinyEngine

TinyScript is a scripting language that is an implementation of a Tree-walk interpreted language. TinyEngine fetches and executes instructions directly from your TinyScript file. This means that TinyEngine reads each line and executes it before going to the next line. This is a contrast from programming languages such as C++ which compiles the whole source code into binary format, thereafter executing the program from the binary output.

The interpreter was written with the help of [this excellent book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)!

The language syntax is inspired by **BASIC**: a former, important programming language in history.

## Basic Concepts

> [!NOTE]
> The language syntax is case-sensitive and requires uppercase

### Comments

Any text starting at a leading `#` to the end of a line will be ignored by TinyEngine.

```
# Single line comment

# Multi-line comments
# can be created
# like this
```

### Data Types

TinyScript only uses ONE data type: a 16-bit signed integer. Every data or variable that you will be interacting with is a 16-bit signed integer, capable of storing `-32,768` up to `32,767`. If you attempt to store numbers outside that range, you will encounter an integer underflow or overflow.

### Memory & Variables

TinyEngine acts as a virtual machine, giving you a virtual memory heap structure that you can access directly. The heap structure contains single memory 'blocks' between `0` (inclusive) and `63` (inclusive). 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to initialise memory blocks before using them. 

To write the result of an equation into memory block 40:

```
M40 = 18 * (-6 / 5)
```

To read from memory blocks 11 and 12, and store their sum into block 1: 

```
M1 = M11 + M12
```

Memory blocks are not scoped and can be accessed anywhere in the program.

### Conditions

TinyScript supports if statements and while loops. These control flows depend on comparisons and conditions. Values that are non-zero are regarded as "true", and zero values are regarded as "false".

> [!NOTE]
> Any comparison operations returns a '1' or '0' integer

To check if Memory block 8 is greater than 6 and save the value true to block 7:

```
M8 = 110
M7 = M8 > 6     # M7 will store 1
```

To check is 8 if equal to 3:

```
M0 = 8 == 3
```

Logic operators `NOT`, `OR` and `AND` are also supported. Remember non-zero values are true!

```
M7 = NOT 6      
# Not of 6 (true) is 0 (false)
# M7 stores 0 now

M10 = (NOT 0) AND (5 + 6 == 11)
# NOT 0 is 1 (true)
# 5 + 6 == 11 is 1 (true)
# 1 AND 1 is 1 (true)
```
    
### Control Flow

#### IF statements

If statements work in TinyScript, just as any other language. An if statement requires an opening `IF`, a condition, a proceeding `THEN` and a closing `END` to signal to the interpreter the end of the current if statement.

To check if Memory block 5 is greater than or equal to 4:

```
IF M5 >= M4 THEN
	M4 = M4 + 1
END
```

A single `ELSE` statement is allowed before the END statement:

```
IF M5 >= M4 THEN
	M4 = M4 + 1
ELSE
	M5 = M5 + 1
END
```

Multiple `IF-ElSE` branches are allowed:

``` 
IF NOT M0 OR M9 THEN
	# Branch 1
ELSE IF
	# Branch 2
ELSE IF 
	# Branch 3
ELSE
	# Default Branch
END
```

#### WHILE statements

While statements require an opening `WHILE`, a condition, a proceeding `DO`, and a closing `END` to signal to TinyEngine the end of the current while statement.


To loop 10 times:

```
M0 = 0
WHILE M0 < 10 DO
	M0 = M0 + 1
END
```
> [!WARNING]
> Be wary of infinite loops :)

#### NESTING

Control flows can be nested into each other:
```
M0 = 0
M1 = 3
WHILE M0 < 10 DO
	M0 = M0 + 1

	IF M0 == 7 THEN
		M1 = 4

		WHILE M1 < 20 DO
			M1 = M1 + 2
		END
	END
END
```

### Custom Functions

#### Overview

Functions work as usual in TinyScript as in every other language. When you define a function, TinyEngine marks down the location of that function in the file in a function register. The function register behaves similarly to the memory heap; a maximum of 16 functions from `0` to `15` (inclusive) are able to be defined.

#### Definitions

Custom functions are primitive in TinyScript. No return types or parameters are supported directly; however due to the nature of the direct access heap, one can reserve memory blocks for the parameters of a function or return data.


To define a simple function to add two numbers, this function will be stored in function registry location 6:

```
DEFINE FUNC6 THEN
    M3 = M1 + M2
END
```

> [!NOTE]
> The latest definition of a function in registry location X will always overwrite previous definitions in registry location X if it exists

#### Calling

To call the newly defined `FUNC6`, write:

```
CALL FUNC6
```

### Coordinate Sytem

TinyEngine's coordinate system starts from (0,0) which is the top left corner. For increasing x values, it refers to points going to the right of the screen from the left. For increasing y values, it refers to points going down the screen from the top.

## Built-ins

### Overview

Various built in variables and functions are provided for you to interact with the game engine

### Variables

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Variable Name</th>
      <th width="70%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>JOYSTICK_X</code> / <code>JOYSTICK_Y</code></td>
      <td>
      The current horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) coordinate inputs from the joystick. Ranges from <code>-100</code> to <code>100</code> to represent if pulled in one direction or the other. <code>0</code> if not moved.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>JOYSTICK_BUTTON</code></td>
      <td>The digital input state indicating whether the joystick is pressed down.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>BUTTON_A</code></td>
      <td>An auxiliary button 'A' utilized for secondary operations or actions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>TIME</code></td>
      <td>A millisecond clock tracking elapsed time using an unsigned 16-bit integer that overflows/resets back to <code>0</code> after reaching <code>32,767</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SCREEN_WIDTH</code></td>
      <td>The maximum horizontal pixel resolution of the display screen.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SCREEN_HEIGHT</code></td>
      <td>The maximum vertical pixel resolution of the display screen.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Functions

Built-in functions take a slightly different approach; for one, they do not have to be defined by the programmer (hence built-in!) and these functions **do support function arguments**. However, return types are not supported and not needed!

Function arguments are comma-delimited and support expressions.

The following lists all the functions available for use:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">Function</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/CLEAR.md"><strong>CLEAR</strong></a></td>
      <td>Clears the screen buffer or system state.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/DISPLAY.md"><strong>DISPLAY</strong></a></td>
      <td>Initialises or updates the emulated game engine screen display.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/FILL.md"><strong>FILL</strong></a></td>
      <td>Paints the entire screen with a specified colour.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/INPUT.md"><strong>INPUT</strong></a></td>
      <td>Reads controller, keyboard, or hardware input states.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/LINE.md"><strong>LINE</strong></a></td>
      <td>Draws a line with a start coordinate and end coordinate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="Functions/POINT.md"><strong>POINT</strong></a></td>
      <td>Draws a single pixel on the screen using an absolute coordinate.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Good Practices & Tips

#### Opening a window

TinyEngine leaves the responsibility of updating itself to the programmer (you). To ensure that your game runs continuously and a window displays for your game, place updating code for **both** input and display updates:

```
WHILE 1 DO
	# Your game logic here

	# Update the game engine
	CALL INPUT
	CALL DISPLAY
END
```

> [!WARNING]
> Not continuously calling `DISPLAY` will make your game window freeze 
> `DISPLAY` is vital to tell your OS to keep your window alive

### Quitting your game

An extra tip to allow users to quit your game is to run your game loop until a user does a specific action. For example, if a user presses button A to quit.

```
WHILE NOT BUTTON_A DO
	# Your game logic here

	# Update the game engine
	CALL INPUT
	CALL DISPLAY
END
```

### Drawing Thick Lines or Polygons

Since the game engine only supports basic primitive drawing at this moment, line thickness and squares are not natively supported. To draw them, just use a while loop to create multiple lines for a "thick" line. Apply the same technique for squares.

For example:

```
M1 = 10  # Starting Y coordinate
WHILE M1 < 20 DO
    CALL LINE 5, M1, 50, M1, 255, 0, 255
    M1 = M1 + 1
END
```
