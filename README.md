# Features

* 2D Game Engine
* Custom Game Scripting Language
* Joystick + Button support (Broken)
* Console Emulation on PC

### Game Engine

The game engine and language reference are available at [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md).


# Installation

## Binary Releases

Install the binary releases [here](https://github.com/111nation/Arduino-Handheld-Console/releases) for your target Operating System. 

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

Unzip the downloaded zipped file and run the project within the folder by double-clicking on it.

Alternatively, you can open a terminal window **within the root of the folder** and execute the following to run via the CLI.

```powershell
.\main.exe
```

 </details>

 <details>
  <summary>Linux (Unix)</summary>
  
Unzip the downloaded zip file by running the following in the same directory as the downloaded zip file.
```bash
unzip <Folder Name> .
cd <Folder Name>
```
To execute the binary via CLI, execute:

```powershell
./main
```
    
 </details>

 <details>
  <summary>MacOS</summary>
  
Unzip the downloaded zip file. You can do this by running the following in the same directory as the downloaded zip file.
```bash
unzip <Folder Name> .
cd <Folder Name>
```
Execute `main` within the unzipped folder or to execute the binary via CLI, execute:

```powershell
./main
```
    
 </details>
 

## Build From Source

Make sure you have the various prerequisites.

### Requirements
* C++ Compiler linked to your `PATH`
* CMake Version 3.23 or higher
* Make
* Git

### Building & Executing

> [!NOTE]
> Building commands may differ depending on your environment

Clone the repository onto your local system using the following.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/111nation/Arduino-Handheld-Console
```

Enter the cloned repository and enter the `GameEngine` directory to build and execute the Emulator.

```bash
cd Arduino-Handheld-Console
cd GameEngine

cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## How the Game Engine Works

### Loading Games

When emulating the game engine on your personal computer, the game engine is hard coded to load a game from the programs folder, `$ROOT/programs/main`, where `$ROOT` is the current working directory the program was executed at. This currently functions as a basic bootloader for the game console to fetch the first instructions (which is just a single game at this point).

Depending if you downloaded a precompiled binary or built from source, `$ROOT` is the unzipped folder installed the precompiled binary or `$ROOT` is the `GameEngine` folder where cmake was executed.

Keep all custom written games in `$ROOT/programs/`, 'load' a game by renaming it to `main` in the programs folder.

> [!TIP]
> Two sample games, a drawing and a pong game has been included as a demo

### Scripting Games

This is the most fun part! This section is viewable at [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md)
